# GitLab CE deployment using two external volumes; one for data and another
# for configuration. These volumes needs to be created prior to starting GitLab
# using the following commands:
# docker volume create gitlab-data
# docker volume create gitlab-config
#
# In addition you may want to change the hostname value in the Docker-Compose
# configuration below to match the name of your server/computer on which
# GitLab is to be run.
#
# Once started, access GitLab using the URL http://localhost:8880.
#
# The following ports are exposed by GitLab:
# 8880 (HTTP)
# 443 (if you configure HTTPS)
# 8080 (used by Unicorn)
# 8822 (used by the SSH daemon)
#
# The GitLab documentation suggests the following line to be added to the
# GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG environment variable.
# external_url 'http://hostname:8880'
# However, with this line present I am unable to access the GitLab webpage.
